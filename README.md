# recycam
Did you know the global average of recycling is 19%? Have YOU ever felt unsure about an object's recyclability? Recycam relieves this stressful decision that seems small but actually matters a lot.

We mainly developed Recycam with the use of Python, Swift, and Google Colab. Our project has two main functionsâ€“classifying the recyclability of an item and providing the user with general insight about recyclable items.
